## About me
[back home](aminahajiyeva.github.io)

Hi, I’m Amina Hajiyeva, a second-year electrical engineering student at Carleton University with a passion for innovation and problem-solving. My academic journey has equipped me with hands-on experience in circuit design, programming in C, and developing practical engineering solutions.
Through projects like designing a HUD helmet display for extreme sports and creating digital systems using Xilinx ISE, I’ve cultivated a strong interest in embedded systems and optical engineering. My involvement in outreach programs like McMaster’s iBioMed Design Like A Girl and Waterloo’s Catalyst Conference has further fueled my drive to explore interdisciplinary applications of technology.
Outside the classroom, I’m passionate about entrepreneurship, aiming to launch an abaya company with my sister. I also enjoy exploring how engineering solutions can address real-world challenges, from safety innovations to personal care products like my viral massager brush concept for postpartum hair loss.
I’m currently seeking opportunities in electrical engineering, particularly in design, testing, and embedded systems. With a keen interest in applying my skills in cooperative settings, I’m excited to contribute to impactful projects that make a difference.
Let’s connect and explore how technology can transform ideas into reality!
